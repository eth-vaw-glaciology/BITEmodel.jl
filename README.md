# Bayesian Ice Thickness Estimation (BITE) model

Accompaning publication:

A Bayesian ice thickness estimation model for large-scale applications, Mauro A. Werder et al (2019)

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2019.93

See directory `scripts/` for an example.

**Note:** this runs on the, by now, very old Julia 0.6. If you want to use it, best ping me (i.e. open an issue) and I'll get it updated to Julia v1.
