Surging, biting Vernagtferner by R. Reschreiter (1911)

This model can be used to estimate ice thickness maps of mountain
glaciers and ice caps.  It needs surface elevation and a glacier
outline and can make use of the following additional data: surface
mass balance, elevation change, ice thickness measurements (usually
radar), and also expert guesses.  It uses a Bayesian framework
implemented numerically using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
